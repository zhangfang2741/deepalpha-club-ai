# FastAPI LangGraph Agent Template

A production-ready template for building AI agent backends with FastAPI and LangGraph. Handles the hard parts — stateful conversations, long-term memory, tool calling, observability, rate limiting, auth — so you can focus on your agent logic.

**Built for AI engineers** who want a solid foundation, not a tutorial project.

## What's included

- **LangGraph** stateful agent with checkpointing, tool calling, and human-in-the-loop support
- **Long-term memory** via mem0 + pgvector — semantic search per user, cache-backed
- **LLM service** with circular model fallback, exponential backoff retries, and total timeout budget
- **Langfuse** tracing on all LLM calls; Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
- **JWT auth** with session management; rate limiting via slowapi
- **Alembic** migrations; optional Valkey/Redis cache layer
- **Structured logging** with request/session/user context on every line

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <repo-url> my-agent && cd my-agent
cp .env.example .env.development   # fill in your keys
make install
make docker-up                     # starts API + PostgreSQL
```

## FAQ

### General

**What is this template?**
A production-ready foundation for AI agent backends built on FastAPI + LangGraph. It bundles the components you'd otherwise wire up by hand: stateful conversations, long-term memory, tool calling, observability, rate limiting, and JWT auth.

**How does this differ from a basic LangGraph setup?**
The base LangGraph quickstart stops at "agent runs locally". This template adds Alembic migrations, mem0 + pgvector long-term memory, Langfuse tracing, Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, JWT sessions, slowapi rate limiting, structured logging with per-request context, and a circular-fallback LLM service — production concerns you'd otherwise build separately.

### Setup & Configuration

**Do I need Docker?**
Recommended but not required. `make docker-up` starts the API + PostgreSQL together. For local-only setup see [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

**Which LLM providers are supported?**
Today: **OpenAI only** via the `LLMRegistry` in `app/services/llm/registry.py`. Multi-provider support (Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter) via LangChain's `init_chat_model` is planned — see [#51](https://github.com/wassim249/fastapi-langgraph-agent-production-ready-template/issues/51). Configure your model via `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` in `.env.development`.

**How do I configure long-term memory?**
Long-term memory is self-hosted: mem0 runs in-process and persists into your existing PostgreSQL via pgvector — there is no separate mem0 cloud account or API key. You only need a working `OPENAI_API_KEY` (used for fact extraction + embeddings) and the pgvector extension enabled. See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md) for details.

### Development

**How do I add a custom tool?**
Drop a LangChain `@tool`-decorated function in `app/core/langgraph/tools/` and register it in the `tools` list exported from that package. The agent picks it up on next start; no graph changes needed.

**How does the LLM service handle failures?**
Two layers: (1) per-call exponential-backoff retry via `tenacity`, (2) **circular fallback** — if the active model exhausts its retries, the service rotates to the next model in `LLMRegistry` and continues. A total timeout budget caps the whole call so latency stays bounded. See [docs/llm-service.md](docs/llm-service.md).

**Can I use this without Langfuse?**
Yes. Set `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED=false` (or omit the Langfuse keys). The agent runs unchanged; structured logs still capture request/session/user context.

### Troubleshooting

**The API won't start**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running (`make docker-up` brings it up alongside the API)
- Confirm `.env.development` exists — copy from `.env.example` and fill in required keys
- Apply migrations: `make migrate`

**Memory / semantic search returns nothing**
- Verify the `pgvector` extension is enabled in your PostgreSQL instance
- Confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid (mem0 calls OpenAI for fact extraction + embeddings)
- Check `LONG_TERM_MEMORY_MODEL` and `LONG_TERM_MEMORY_EMBEDDER_MODEL` are set in `.env.development`

**Rate limiting is too aggressive**
Limits are defined in `app/core/limiter.py` (slowapi). Adjust per-route decorators or the default rate in that file. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the related env vars.
